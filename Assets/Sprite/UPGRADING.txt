NOTES ON UPGRADING

Note for 2.1.0

The new SDK contains three changes which you should be aware of:
1. Added support for additional auth scopes using [requestServerSideAccess](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/unity/unity-start#retrieve-auth-codes).
2. Removed the deprecated [Google Sign-In](https://developer.android.com/identity/legacy/gsi) dependency.
3. Removed the deprecated [Google Drive](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/drive/Drive) dependency.

There are no major changes related to sign-in flow.

Before importing the unity package for v2.0.0, delete
`Assets/Plugins/Android/com.google.android.gms.play-services-games-<version_number>.aar`
and everything under `Assets/GooglePlayGames`. You can then follow the regular
integration process.
